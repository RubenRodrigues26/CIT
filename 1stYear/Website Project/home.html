			<p>The history of chocolate begins in Mesoamerica. Chocolate, the fermented, roasted, and ground beans of the Theobroma cacao, can be traced to 
			the Mokaya and other pre-Olmec people, with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BC. The Aztecs believed that cacao seeds were 
			the gift of Quetzalcoatl, the God of wisdom, and the seeds had so much value they were used as a form of currency. Originally prepared only as a 
			drink, chocolate was served as a bitter, frothy liquid, mixed with spices, wine or corn puree. It was believed to have aphrodisiac powers and to 
			give the drinker strength.<br>

			After its arrival in the sixteenth century, sugar was added to it and it became popular through Europe, first among the ruling classes and 
			then among the common people. In the 20th century, chocolate was considered a staple, essential in the rations of United States soldiers at war.<br>

			The word "chocolate" comes from the Classical Nahuatl word chocolƒÅtl, and entered the English language from Spanish.</p>
