From expertly trained pilots to<br>exacting maintenance standards, we pride<br>ourselves on offering one of the safest fleet<br>experiences in the sky.</h5></div><section id=block11><section class=innersection><h3>Superior Fleet</h3><p>We own and operate one of the finest and largest fleet of Challenger 300 and Citation X super mid-size jets in the country. Not only does our fleet offer an exceptional onboard experience, each jet also features advanced safety equipment including Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems, Automated External Defibrillators, and iPad equipped pilots to access a suite of FAA and operational resources.<h3>Skilled Pilots</h3><p>Our pilots are commanders of the sky. Each of LUXAIR's 150+ pilots have been carefully selected from the best in the industry—averaging more than 7,500 hours of flight time. Every LUXAIR flight is under the command of two full-time, type-rated FAA-recognized captains, meeting stringent requirements that exceed FAA standards. Our pilots undergo semi-annual, recurrent training which emphasizes scenario-based simulations of operationally challenging airports including mountain destinations.<h3>Rigorous Maintenance</h3><p>All aircraft maintenance is completed to manufacturer specifications by top tier vendors, under the supervision of our highly trained Field Service Supervisors. In between scheduled maintenance events, we have implemented key inspection checkpoints and service measures to enhance the reliability of our fleet. Additionally, our expert teams participate in Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) advisory boards to exchange data and collectively improve the fleet reliability.<h3>Operational Risk Management</h3><p>At LUXAIR, we own and operate a fleet of aircraft, and handpick and train our skilled pilots. By doing so, we have developed deep insight and expertise into proactive operational risk management—a true LUXAIR differentiator.<br>With this in mind, we developed an industry-leading and proprietary Pilot Wellness Program to measure and manage variables related to crew tasking and crew rest. Statistics show that fatigued pilots are more likely to make mistakes, thus we have implemented best practices which compensate for time zone differences and incorporate increased rest time between trips—another example of industry safety leadership.</section></section></main><footer>©2016 LuxAir Air Lines, Inc. | Travel won't be on other airlines.<br>Terms and conditions apply to all offers and SkyMiles benefits.
